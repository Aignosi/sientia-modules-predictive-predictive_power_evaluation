Repository Policy

All contributions to Pandorabox must be tracked by an issue and at least one pull request. To start work on an issue you must fork Pandorabox repository, pick an issue and when you have did your first commit on your fork you have to create a pull request to Pandorabox devel branch so we can see your work in progress. The pull request name must follow this pattern: {STATE} {ISSUE NUMBER} - {ISSUE NAME}. Where {STATE} is the state of the pull request, all pull requests must be created with [WIP] tag and when you think you resolved the issue change to [REVIEW]. Example of pull request name: [WIP] 435 - Refactor create method.
